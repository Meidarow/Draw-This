# Draw-This

**Draw-This** is a lightweight desktop app for running timed slideshow sessions.  
Built with **Tkinter** for the GUI and (for the time being) using **FEH** for Linux-only slideshow support.

---

## Features

- Add, remove, and toggle folders containing your reference images
- Set custom timers or choose the predefined duration
- Start slideshow sessions with selected folders and timer
- **FEH integration** for users who already have it installed, it should run out of the box.
- ELSE PLEASE INSTALL FEH, it is super lightweight and you will not regret it
- Currently feh starts on the right half of the screen, taking up half of a 1080p screen's real-estate, but it CAN be set to fullscreen (manually for now)
