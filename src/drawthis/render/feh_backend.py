"""
FEH Backend for Draw-This.

This module defines the interface between the GUI and FEH:
It has a single function:

- start_slideshow:
Accepts a series of parameters and builds a bash command calling feh
with a series of flags, according to user preferences. Must use the whole
DB since feh cannot load paths incrementally.

Usage
